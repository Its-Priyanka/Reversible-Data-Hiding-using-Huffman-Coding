# Reversible-Data-Hiding-using-Huffman-Coding
This is a security based project in which a medical image of the patient is encrypted using the stream cipher algorithm followed by the embedding of the secret message inside the image using the Huffman compressio algorithm .
after embedding the extraction of the secret message and the restoration of original image is performed.
